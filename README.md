# Keylogger in C++ üñ•Ô∏è

## Description üìú
This project is a **minimalist keylogger** developed in C++ for educational purposes, aimed at understanding how to capture keystrokes using the Windows API. It detects pressed keys and logs them into a text file named `Record.txt`.

### Features
- Logs all keyboard inputs, including:
  - Letters and numbers.
  - Special keys like `<Tab>`, `<Return>`, `<Back>`.
  - Characters specific to keyboard layouts (e.g., `√†`, `√ß`, etc.).
- Handles special states: Caps Lock, Shift, Alt Gr, and Alt.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note**: This project is solely for educational purposes. Using software like this without proper authorization may violate laws. Always adhere to ethical and legal standards.

## Included Files üóÇÔ∏è
- **Source Code (`keylogger.cpp`)**: Contains the complete keylogger code.
- **Executable (`main.exe`)**: Compiled binary ready for execution.

---

## VirusTotal Results üõ°Ô∏è
The executable was scanned on **VirusTotal** and received a score of **4/72**, meaning its quite stealthy

## Usage ‚öôÔ∏è

### 1. Prerequisites
- Windows OS
- A C++ compiler (e.g., MinGW or Visual Studio) if you wish to compile the source code.

### 2. Execution
Run the `main.exe` executable. All keyboard inputs will be logged into the `Record.txt` file.
